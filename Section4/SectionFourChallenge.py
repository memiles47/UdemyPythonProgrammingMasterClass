Write a program to print a number of options and allow the user to
select an option from the list.

The options should be numbered from 1 to 9 - although you can use less
than 9 options if you want.

Make sure there are at least 4 options.

The program should continue looping allowing the user to choose one of
the options each time around.

The loops should only terminate when the user chooses 0.

If the user makes a valid choice the program should print a short message
and the message should include the value that they typed.

Don't print a different message for each choice - the only thing that
should change is the number they typed.

Although you could print the description I want show you a much better
way of doing that later.

We're keeping this simple because there are still lots of things we haven't
covered yet.

If their choice isn't one of the options in the menu, nothing should be
printed although you will see their input on the screen.

As an optional extra, modify the program so that the menu is printed 
again if they choose an invalid option.

Be careful with that one: you may start off by duplicating the code to
print the menu but it's possible to write the program without duplicating
the print lines.
